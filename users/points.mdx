Basemarket has plans to introduce a points program for community members who support the platform.

## Current Status: Season 0

We are currently in Season 0 of the points program. During this period:

- Points **are** being tracked.
- There is no way to view your points balance yet.
- From Season 1 onwards, points will be viewable.

## How to Earn Points

To prevent abuse, we are not disclosing specific details about how points are accumulated. However, actions you take to support the platform will be rewarded with points.

Stay active, provide liquidity, engage with the platform, and contribute to the Basemarket community.

## Future Plans

There is no commitment towards a token or airdrops at this stage. However, the points program is designed to recognize and reward community members who help build and support Basemarket.
