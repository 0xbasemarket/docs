title: Market Resolution
description: How prediction markets are resolved on Basemarket
---

Market resolution is the process of finalizing a market's outcome once the real-world event concludes. On Basemarket, market resolution is powered by [UMA Optimistic Oracle](https://uma.xyz/), a decentralized smart-contract based protocol.

### How Resolution Works

Markets are resolved according to pre-defined rules specified before trading begins. You can find these rules in the market details.

When a market resolves:

- Winning shares are redeemable for \$1.00 each.
- Losing shares become worthless.
- Trading is no longer possible.

### Resolution Process

1. **Event Occurs** - The real-world event happens or the deadline passes.
2. **Outcome Verified** - The result is verified against the market's resolution source.
3. **Outcome Proposed** - A proposer proposes the outcome, placing a bond that will be forfeited should the proposal be incorrect.
4. **Challenge Window Begins** - A timed challenge window begins (typically 2 hours, however, can be as short as a few minutes), under which the proposed outcome can be disputed.
5. **Market Resolved** - If no dispute occurs, the market is officially finalized to the correct outcome.
6. **Shares Settled** - Winning positions become redeemable.

  **Timeline:** Certain markets may resolve within minutes of their conclusion.
  A majority of markets are resolved within 24 hours after the conclusion of the
  event.

### Resolution Sources

Each market specifies an objective source used to determine the outcome. Common sources include:

- **Official Data** - Government agencies, regulatory bodies.
- **Major News Outlets** - Associated Press, Reuters, Bloomberg, BBC.
- **Sports Statistics** - ESPN, official league websites.
- **Blockchain Data** - On-chain data from block explorers.
- **Financial Data** - Stock exchanges (eg. NYSE, Nasdaq), Crypto exchanges (eg. Coinbase, Binance, Hyperliquid).

#### Example Resolution Criteria

**Bitcoin Price Market:**

- Source: Coinbase.
- Resolves YES if spot BTC â‰¥ $150,000 at 11:59:00 PM ET on Coinbase Exchange on December 31, 2025.

**Election Market:**

- Source: Associated Press official race call.
- Resolves to the candidate declared winner by AP.

**Sports Market:**

- Source: ESPN official box score.
- Resolves YES if Lakers score > Warriors score (including overtime).

### Invalid Resolutions

In rare cases, a market may resolve as invalid (N/A) if:

- The event is cancelled with no alternative specified.
- The resolution source is permanently unavailable.
- The outcome is genuinely indeterminate per market rules.

<Warning>
  **Rare Occurrence:** Invalid resolutions are extremely rare because markets
  are designed with clear, objective criteria.
</Warning>

### Disputing Resolutions

If you believe a market was resolved incorrectly, you can submit a dispute. See [Market Dispute](/users/market-dispute) for details on the dispute process.

### Before Trading

Always review a market's resolution criteria before trading:

- Understand how the outcome will be determined.
- Verify the resolution source is reliable and objective.
- Check for any special conditions or edge cases.
- Ensure you agree with the specified criteria.
