### How Markets Are Created

Markets on Basemarket are created by the Basemarket team. We actively take input from users in the community to ensure we're creating markets that traders want to participate in.

### Submit Your Market Idea

We welcome market suggestions from the community. To submit your idea, tag us on Twitter [@PredictOnBase](https://x.com/PredictOnBase) with:

- **Market question** - A clear, specific question with a definitive yes/no outcome.
- **Resolution source** - The objective source that will be used to determine the outcome.
- **Evidence of demand** - Why you think there's interest in trading on this market.

### User-Created Markets

Currently, we do not allow users to create markets directly. While this is something we may explore in the future, there are no immediate plans to enable user-created markets.
