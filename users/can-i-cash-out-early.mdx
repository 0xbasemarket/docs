You can cash out your shares at any time before the market resolves.

## Where to Cash Out

You can sell your shares from two places:

- **Market detail page** – Click on the market and select "Sell" in the positions section.
- **Portfolio page** – View all your positions and sell directly from your portfolio.

You don't have to wait until the event occurs - exit your position whenever you want to lock in profits, cut losses, or free up capital for other opportunities.
