Market orders are the fastest way to trade on Basemarket. They execute immediately at the current best available price.

### What is a Market Order?

A market order is an instruction to buy or sell shares instantly at the best price currently available in the [order book](/users/order-book).

**Key characteristics:**

- **Instant execution** - Trades happen immediately.
- **Dollar-based** - You specify how much USD you want to spend.
- **Average price** - Your order may fill at multiple prices to complete the full amount.
- **No cancellation** - Cannot be cancelled once placed.

### How It Works

When you place a market order:

1. **Choose your side** - Select YES or NO.
2. **Enter amount** - Specify how much USD you want to spend (e.g., \$100).
3. **Review execution** - See your estimated "To Win" amount.
4. **Confirm** - Click "Buy Yes" or "Buy No" to execute immediately.

Your order matches with the best available [limit orders](/users/limit-orders) in the order book, filling at progressively worse prices until your full dollar amount is spent.

### Price Impact & Average Price

**Price Impact** occurs when your order size exceeds the available liquidity at the best price, forcing your order to fill at multiple price levels.

**Example:**
You place a market order to buy \$100 worth of YES shares. The order book shows:

```
Sell Orders (Asks):
17¢ - 200 shares ($34 available).
18¢ - 300 shares ($54 available).
19¢ - 400 shares ($76 available).
```

Your $100 order will:

- Buy ~200 shares at 17¢ ($34).
- Buy ~300 shares at 18¢ ($54).
- Buy ~63 shares at 19¢ ($12).
- **Total**: ~563 shares for \$100.
- **Average price**: ~17.8¢ per share.

The larger your order relative to available liquidity, the more price impact you'll experience.

<Warning>
  **Check liquidity first**: In thin markets, large market orders can experience
  significant slippage (worse average price). Always check the [order
  book](/users/order-book) depth before placing large orders.
</Warning>

### When to Use Market Orders

**Use market orders when:**

- You want to trade immediately.
- The spread is tight (1-2¢).
- You're trading smaller amounts.
- Speed matters more than getting a specific price.

**Avoid market orders when:**

- The spread is wide (>5¢).
- The market has low liquidity.
- You're trading large amounts relative to order book depth.
- You want to wait for a better price (use [limit orders](/users/limit-orders) instead).
