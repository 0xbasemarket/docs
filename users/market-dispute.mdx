Anyone can challenge a proposed market outcome if they believe it was submitted incorrectly.

### How to Dispute

Once an outcome is proposed, a challenge window opens (typically 2 hours). During this period, you can dispute the proposal on the [UMA Oracle platform](https://oracle.uma.xyz/) by posting a dispute bond equal to the proposer's bond.

<Warning>
  **Important:** If your dispute is unsuccessful, you will forfeit your entire
  bond. Only dispute if you are confident the proposed outcome is incorrect
  according to the market's resolution criteria.
</Warning>

### Dispute Process

1. **Challenge Period** - After an outcome is proposed, a challenge window begins.
2. **Submit Dispute** - Post your dispute bond on the UMA platform.
3. **Debate Period** - A 24-48 hour discussion period begins where anyone can contribute evidence in the UMA Discord server (#evidence-rationale and #voting-discussion channels).
4. **Voting Period** - UMA token holders vote on the dispute (approximately 48 hours).
5. **Resolution** - One of four outcomes occurs.

### Possible Outcomes

#### Proposer Correct

The original proposal was accurate:

- Proposer receives their bond back plus half the disputer's bond as reward.
- Disputer loses their bond.
- Market settles with originally proposed outcome.

#### Disputer Correct

The dispute was valid:

- Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposer's bond as reward.
- Proposer loses their bond.
- Market settles with disputer's proposed outcome.

#### Proposed Too Early

The event hasn't concluded yet (e.g., a sports match still in progress):

- Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposer's bond as reward.
- Proposer loses their bond.

#### Indeterminate

Used rarely when no other outcome applies:

- Market resolves to 50% YES / 50% NO.
- Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposer's bond as reward.
- Proposer loses their bond.

### Before Disputing

Make sure to:

- Review the market's exact resolution criteria.
- Verify the resolution source yourself.
- Gather clear evidence supporting your position.
- Understand you will lose your bond if unsuccessful.
